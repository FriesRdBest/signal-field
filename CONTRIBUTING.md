# Contributing to signal-field

Thank you for your interest in improving signal-field. This repository explores visual direction and interface patterns for complex AI product experiences using Python and Streamlit.

## Before you contribute

- Review the [README](README.md) for the project scope and local setup.
- Search existing issues before opening a new one.
- Keep proposals focused on clarity, accessibility, and stakeholder decision support.
- Do not include client data, confidential business information, credentials, API keys, or personal information in issues, pull requests, screenshots, or exported files.

## Local setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FriesRdBest/signal-field.git
cd signal-field
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

On Windows PowerShell, activate the virtual environment with:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

## Contribution guidelines

1. Create a branch from `main`.
2. Make one focused change at a time.
3. Run the app locally and exercise the affected workflow.
4. Check formatting and syntax before opening a pull request:

```bash
python -m py_compile app.py
git diff --check
```

5. In your pull request, explain the problem, the change, validation performed, and any user-facing impact.

## Design principles

- Keep the interface understandable for non-technical stakeholders.
- Prefer clear decision support over decorative complexity.
- Preserve responsive behavior across desktop, tablet, and mobile widths.
- Maintain the light, executive-facing visual language.
- Treat exported summaries as stakeholder-facing documents.

## Reporting issues

Use the repository issue templates for bugs and feature requests. For security concerns, follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) instead of opening a public issue.
